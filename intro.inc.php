    The very first time I came with this idea (of creating a CSS framework) was when I wanted to document my whole process of building a website from scratch. It was around Nov/Dec 2020. Mid-way of documenting of what was going to be a series of blog posts, I realized that -- Wait! I think I can make a small CSS library out of this...

    So I wrote two blog posts named "On Creating My Own CSS Framework - Base" and another one "On Creating My Own CSS Framework - Layout".
